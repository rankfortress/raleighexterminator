	We’re a very experienced company and we’re proud to say that we’ve been able to evolve as a company as well. Of course, we don’t use the exact same chemicals and methods that we began using when we opened the business. As with any pest removal company you can expect much safer chemicals being now used in the services that we offer. We’re always looking for the perfect balance between effectiveness in our services and your safety. If we make suggestions like not using your mattress for a couple of days after our services we do so for your safety.
	
	There are different types of procedures that we’re going to be able to apply to help you get rid of bed bugs. We have heat treatments and direct removal in many extreme cases. There’s a whole process that we go through to make sure that we’re ultimately using the right type of treatment that’s going to help you truly get rid of bed bugs and any type of pests that could be lurking around your sleep area.
